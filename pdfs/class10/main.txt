Unit 1: Digital Documentation (Advanced) using LibreOffice Writer
Chapter 1. Introduction to Styles
________________________________________
1. What do you understand by styles in LibreOffice Writer document?
Ans :  Styles are predefined sets of formatting instructions (like font, size, color, spacing, alignment) that can be applied quickly to text, paragraphs, pages, and objects to maintain consistency in a document.
________________________________________
2. Write advantages of using Style over manual formatting, for designing a document.
Ans : Ensures uniform and consistent formatting throughout the document. Saves time because changes to a style automatically update all text using that style.
________________________________________
3. What are the different categories of style in LibreOffice Writer document?
Ans : Paragraph Styles, Character Styles, Page Styles, Frame Styles, List Styles, Table Styles
________________________________________
4. Write down the steps to update a style.
Ans : Format a paragraph or text manually the way you want.
	Open the Styles Sidebar (F11).
	Right-click the style you want to change.
	Select Update Style.
The style will update using the formatting from the selected text.
________________________________________
5. What do you understand by custom styles in LibreOffice Writer?
Ans : Custom styles are user-created styles where you define your own formatting rules instead of using the built-in default styles. They help apply your own formatting consistently.
________________________________________
6. About the Introduction paragraph formatting steps
Ans : The given steps show manual formatting of the "Introduction" paragraph.
Each formatting feature—font face, font size, bold, font colour, paragraph spacing, and numbering—is applied individually by using toolbar options and the Format menu. This method is used when formatting is done step-by-step instead of using Styles.________________________________________
7. Give two examples, where instead of Style, using manual formatting will be beneficial.
Ans : Two examples are – 
1.	When you need to format a single word or a small text differently (e.g., highlighting one term).
2.	When making temporary or one-time formatting changes that will not be reused in the document.
________________________________________
8. Give one situation in which you will prefer to use Fill Format for styling your document.
Ans : When you want to quickly copy formatting from one text/paragraph and apply it to several other places, Fill Format (paintbrush tool) is useful.
________________________________________
9. Write steps to load style(s) from a template.
Ans :  Steps are as follows –
	Open Styles Sidebar (F11).
	Click the dropdown menu in the Styles window.
	Select Load Styles.
	Browse and choose the template file.
