Unit 4 : Electronic Spreadsheet

E. Short Answer Questions (50 words)

1. What do you call the document created in a spreadsheet application?
Answer : A document created in a spreadsheet application is called a workbook. A workbook contains one or more worksheets used to organize, calculate, and analyze data. Each sheet includes rows, columns, and cells where users enter numbers, text, formulas, and functions for data processing.

2. What are the steps to create a new spreadsheet?
Answer : Open the spreadsheet application (e.g., Calc or Excel), click File → New → Spreadsheet. A new blank workbook opens with default worksheets. You can then enter data, rename sheets, apply formatting, and start calculations using formulas or functions.

3. What is the difference between spreadsheet, worksheet and sheet?
Answer : A spreadsheet is software used for calculations and data organization. A workbook is the entire spreadsheet file. A worksheet or sheet is a single page within the workbook containing rows, columns, and cells. A workbook may contain multiple worksheets for different data sets.

4. What is the default name of the worksheet? How can it be renamed?
Answer : The default worksheet name is Sheet1 (or Sheet2, Sheet3). To rename it, double-click the sheet tab, type the new name, and press Enter. Alternatively, right-click the tab and choose Rename Sheet.

5. Write the steps to insert and delete the worksheet in Calc.
Answer : To insert a worksheet: right-click on any sheet tab → Insert Sheet → choose location → OK.
